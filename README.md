# Golden Armor fix

Fixes the hidden golden plate armor's visibility when worn by an entity or the player.

The armor can be aquired by defeating an [Ylside MX](<https://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Ylside_(MX)>)
or by using the mega-kaom cheat: casting `MEGA + KAOM` 10 times (can be done without the runes too).

The armor requires 18 strength (the chest piece only) and it's not identifiable.
