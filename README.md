# Golden Armor fix

Fixes the hidden golden plate armor's visibility when worn by an entity or the player.

The armor can be aquired by defeating an [Ylside MX](<https://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Ylside_(MX)>)
or by using the mega-kaom cheat: casting `MEGA + KAOM` 10 times (can also be done without having the runes).

- None of the armor pieces are identifiable.
- The leggings and helmet require 12 strength.
- The chest piece requires 18 strength.
